Pick a game of your choosing (board game, card game, video game, etc.). Think of two clear metrics you might be effective as rewards or penalties for an RL agent being trained to play this game. Briefly justify why you think each metric might be effective.","178498161: No more than 2-3 sentences
For the game you picked in question #1, provide an example that clearly illustrates a situation where it might be beneficial for your agent to prioritize exploration over exploitation. Briefly explain your reasoning.","178498165: No more than 2-3 sentences
List 2 potential challenges with implementing an RL agent for the game you chose in question #1. Briefly explain the problem / concern that each present."
Reward the agent for pressing random buttons and penalize it for winning the game. This approach would ensure the agent is trying different strategies without making the game too easy for it.,The agent should always exploit the best-known strategy to ensure it wins the game. Exploring is unnecessary because the optimal strategy has already been found.,"The RL agent might get bored of the game, and it could also cheat to win. These are not valid concerns because agents don't experience emotions or cheat without being programmed to do so."
"Reward the agent for scoring points in the game and penalize it for running out of time. Rewarding points is effective since it aligns with the game�s objective, but penalizing running out of time may not apply to all games, as not every game is time-based."," In a card game, the agent should explore when it is losing badly because trying something new might change the outcome. This is somewhat valid, but it doesn't clearly justify why exploration is beneficial in this specific situation.","One challenge is defining clear reward metrics, as poorly defined rewards could lead to unintended behavior. Another issue is ensuring the agent has enough computational resources to play effectively, but this is vague and not necessarily game-specific."
"Reward the agent for scoring points and penalize it for losing lives or failing a level. Scoring points directly measures progress and aligns with the game�s goal, while penalizing for losing lives ensures the agent learns to avoid risky behaviors that lead to failure."," In a board game like chess, the agent might prioritize exploration in the early game to discover new opening strategies that could give it a long-term advantage. Exploration in this situation helps the agent gather information about strategies it hasn�t fully evaluated, which might be more effective than sticking to known moves."," One challenge is managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, as too much exploration could prevent the agent from optimizing its strategy, while too much exploitation might cause it to miss better strategies. Another challenge is the complexity of the game�s state space, as games with many possible states (like chess) make it computationally expensive to train the agent effectively."
